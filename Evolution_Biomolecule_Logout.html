					<p style="font-size: 25px;" class="biocontent">• DNA</p>
					<p class="biocontent">Ancient DNA can be preserved in a variety of discrete remains, as well as a wide range of depositional archives. While bones and teeth remain the most widely used mineralized specimens for extracting DNA, there is a wealth of other suitable calcified and mineralized substrates, such as eggshells, invertebrate shells, coprolites, and dental calculus, the latter two being particularly valuable for investigating ancient microbiomes. Keratinous material, e.g., hair, claws, and feathers, represents another important, though relatively scarce, source of animal DNA.
					</p>
					<p class="biocontent">Ancient DNA is generally highly fragmented and chemically modified. Endogenous nucleases begin to degrade DNA immediately upon the death of an organism. Soon thereafter, exogenous degradation processes—such as oxidation, hydrolysis, and background radiation—alter the nitrogenous bases and cleave the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA molecules, leading to their destabilization and fragmentation.
					</p>
					</br></br>
					<p style="font-size: 25px;" class="biocontent">• PROTIENS</p>
					<p class="biocontent">When it comes to studying the decay of ancient proteins, one common method is to use sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis. However, unlike modern proteins, ancient protein extracts don't produce clear, distinct bands that we see in freshly denatured proteins. Instead, they leave behind a kind of blurry residue. This is likely because over time, the proteins break down and form connections with other organic compounds like carbohydrates and lipids, resulting in a continuous smear. By using SDS gel electrophoresis, we can get an initial understanding of how ancient proteins have degraded. It's fascinating to see how these proteins have changed over time and how they differ from their modern counterparts.
					</p>
					<p class="biocontent">Deamidation is something that researchers have noticed in almost all ancient protein studies done so far. Interestingly, it tends to be more prevalent in samples that have been exposed to higher temperatures for longer periods of time. A recent discovery has shown that the contaminants typically found in ancient protein extracts don't undergo much deamidation, if any at all. On the other hand, the noncollagenous proteins (NCPs) found in bones naturally experience a lot of deamidation, sometimes reaching close to 100%. Collagens, however, fall somewhere in between, with deamidation rates falling between those of common contaminants and NCPs.
					</p>
					<p class="biocontent">Ancient protein residues undergo various spontaneous changes over time that are not caused by enzymes. Let's take a look at a couple of examples to understand age-related oxidative damage. Kynurenine, a byproduct of tryptophan oxidation, has been found to naturally occur in wool that has been artificially aged. It has also been detected in mammoth bone from the permafrost. Another example is aminoadipic acid, which is derived from lysine. Both of these compounds demonstrate how oxidative damage increases with age. In addition, the carbonylation of arginine and lysine can cause missed cleavages during trypsin digestion, leading to reduced recovery of peptides in ancient samples. We've also observed the presence of carboxymethyllysine, an advanced glycation end product, in a moa bone sample that is less than 1,000 years old.
					</p>
					</br></br>
					<p style="font-size: 25px;" class="biocontent">• LIPIDS</p>
					<p class="biocontent">They are the organic solvent–soluble components of living organisms, for example, oils, fats, waxes, and resins. Relative recalcitrancy is due to low abundances of functional groups and the dominance of saturated aliphatic chains, branches, and rings within the structure, which intrinsically make them resistant to biodegradation and biological decay compared to DNA and proteins, particularly if protected within mineral or organic matrices. Entrapment within either organic or mineral matrices, for example, sediment aggregates, pottery, bone, etc., reduces the loss of biomolecules by diffusion and limits microbial activity by impeding access to lipid substrates.
					</p>
					<p class="biocontent">A notable geological fate of lipids is their condensation with codeposited organic compounds to form geopolymers termed humic or kerogenous. Structurally recognizable lipid can be released from these materials by thermolysis and/or chemolysis.
